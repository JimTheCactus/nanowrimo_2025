Rachel settled in to her bunk to rest after the briefing. A new class of cadets would be joining the academy and they would be settling in to their new bunks today. She wasn't responsible for that process, but she had been asked to be involved in greeting them at the start-of-term party that had been traditionally been held by the older students at the academy for the incoming freshmen.

Rachel wouldn't normally have volunteered to help with something like this, and frankly she hadn't really volunteered this time either. But Sam, which is to say Professor Collins had mentioned that there was going to be another wolfen student in this group, and had hoped that Rachel would be able to help the new student settle in. Wolfen were rare amongst the student body of Hapley Academy, and Sam had reasoned that Rachel was the only other student who could understand what this new blood was going to have to go though. Rachel wasn't sure she agreed with the reasoning; ya, she was the only student, but Sam was herself a wolfen. Couldn't she do it?

Rachel let out out a sigh. It honestly didn't matter much at this point; the professor had won out in the argument, and Rachel was on the hook now to set up streamers and attend the party from start to finish, so griping about it at this point was largely moot. It wasn't all terrible though. After having arrived at the station herself, a lot had happened. It had been a rough ride, but now that she had settled in and worked through some of the initial turmoil, she had been able to make real progress on her initial goals. Her work with Sam had proceeded apace, and her understanding of N-Dimensional Jump Theory was pretty much up to the state of the art now. She was able to keep up with the work that the professor had been working on now, and had been helping her out during free periods.
