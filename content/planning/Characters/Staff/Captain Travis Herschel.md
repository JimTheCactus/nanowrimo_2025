* Extremely warm and gregarious when he's off the clock.
	* Likes to throw back with the staff on the off hours
* Takes his job very seriously.
	* His son is MIA presumed KIA after a naval operation went sideways due to poor planning and ever since he's taken to heart that the work of the academy is to save the lives of the officers and their reporting enlisted.
