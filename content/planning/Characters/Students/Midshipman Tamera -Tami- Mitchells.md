![[Profile Tamera Mitchell.jpg|A confident, friendly, happy, orange, 6 foot tall, petite, furry anthro cheetah woman in a navy blue military uniform with slacks, with medium length black hair, and yellow eyes, standing at the front of a classroom on a space ship assertively leaning on a desk, speaking to several humans. anime, safe for work]]
* Average height and average build for a cheetah
* Voice: Giggly teenager.
* Gregarious and quick to make friends
* Aloof in her dealings with most people, mostly because her personal trauma causes her to have lots of friend, but extremely few close friends.
* Doesn't trust easily, but is deft at navigating around that issue.
* Has learned the art of speaking patiently. Will introduce a pause if necessary to rethink difficult social interactions.
* Student at [[Hapley Military Academy]]
* Serious inferiority complex that she masks by cranking the external confidence to 11.
* Highly social people pleaser. Tries to be secret mom to everyone.
* Roommates with [[Midshipman Mary Daniels|Mary]]

* Is inspired by [[Midshipman Rachel Summers|Rachel]]'s drive to become a researcher in spite of her circumstances.
* Tami is stressed out by people who trust in her skill; it provokes her inferiority complex because if they think she can and she lets them down she'll just prove what she already knows; that she never could do it in the first place.
* Wants to get in to EOD. (Nearly-suicidal work with an obvious benefit. A great way to use a waste of a life.)
* Imagines herself as a fuzed, half melted pair of ice cubes blocking the straw.
* Tami wants to help Rachel start a Movies, Drinks, and Debate club for the kinds of people who like to kibitz during movies.
* Mad at [[Midshipman Dak'thal mon Jee|Dak'thal]] since Rachel's breakdown because she asked them to look over her.
