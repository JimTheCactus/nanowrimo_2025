* Tallish (for a rokk) and dignified in appearance and manner
* Very structured in his take on things, and demanding of things when he feels like his needs aren't being met
* Voice: Very formal, sounds autistic (it's actually just because the rokk don't deal extensively with the human and human-derived cultures, so they don't easily interact.)
* Well connected
* Fussy (think the princess and the pea)
* Student at [[Hapley Military Academy]]
* Doesn't really remember anyone's name.
* Roommates with [[Midshipman Rachel Summers|Rachel]]
