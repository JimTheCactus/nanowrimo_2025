A physical property of our universe that describes an additional, discretely quantized spatial dimension that has the property that each layer's mapping to what we would originally have called "Real Space" follows a vector with a non-unity mapping: i.e. moving one meter on one layer and then shifting to another layer may have you moving two or even two hundred meters in a different layer.

These mappings do follow a pattern, with layers being referred to as "up" if they have a > 1 scaling factor. (i.e. moving a meter on a "higher" layer maps to moving more than one meter on a "lower" layer.) Faster-Than-Light travel then becomes possible by "jumping" or "shifting" "up" to a "higher" layer, moving some distance using conventional drive technologies, and then "shifting" back "down". Moving to higher layers costs more energy than moving to lower layers, but it's never free to move to a different layer.

The lowest layer you can move to is what we would call "Real Space", and is referred to as Layer 0. With that said, there is matter and energy on all layers, so there are planets, stars, colonies, etc. on all layers, though their influence on objects in other layers is limited since very few phenomenon have sufficient energy to exceed the "shift" energy required to jump over the energy barrier between layers. The spacefaring races accomplished this by using a variety of technologies to lower this energy barrier and permit movement along this additional dimensional axis.
