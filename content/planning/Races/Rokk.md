* Height Range (2 sigma): 3’0”-5’0”
- Weight Range (2 sigma): 75 lbs – 200 lbs.
* ~~Silicon-based~~ bodies are hardened by organosilicon
* Essentially rocky mushroom people
* Short and Squat
	* Think like a fat, bulbous goblin
* High silicon diet
* Do not have genders in the traditional sense as they reproduce via spores
* Reproduction is done through the infusion of a medium (usually sandy soil) with spores. The spores differentiate into gametes, which join with other gametophytes to form a zygote which then develops for some time in the soil, attacking and absorbing gametes and other budding zygotes, until typically a single zygote is remaining. This zygote then develops into an infant rokk under the watchful eye of their parents in most rokk cultures. The bulk of the body grows close to the ground with a stalk connecting the bulk of the rokk's myocillium to the growing body at the top of the shoulder. The whole assemblage looks very much like a small boulder due to the silicates woven into the outer surface of the body. Eventually the zygote's connection to their stalk wastes away and their parents begin directly caring for them just like a human infant, though at this point they are able to, and must, eat solid food.
* Home planet was destroyed by a super-volcanic eruption accidentally triggered by their budding industrial civilization, sending an infintessimal fraction of their race to space on Arks as the surface boiled and the rains that fell became highly acidic with dissolved sulfur dioxide. They have since civilized many new permanent homes.
* The extended time trapped on their Arks left them to develop a number of highly differentiated cultures, and it became common to include your ship name when introducing yourself to identify your ethnicity.
* When they finally settled on planets, they maintained this practice. Most of the time you can tell a rokk's home culture just by looking, both physical indicators of their heredity and their outward appearance carry information about their likely culture, but the "ship" names, now extended to function more like national affiliations, have carried into the future.
* First to discover stack travel
* Names follow the shape: \<family\>'\<personal name> mon \<ship name\>
	* Casual acquaintances will use the full family and personal name.
	* Introductions regardless of context will always include the full name including ship name.
	* It is a privilege usually reserved only to people who are very close to refer to a rokk by just their personal name.
* Many rokk nationalities (but not all) are members of the [[United Dimensions Alliance|UDA]]
