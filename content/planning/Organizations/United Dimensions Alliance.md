* The central government of a territory that spans nearly the entirety the our arm of the Milky Way Galaxy
* Constitutional Republic largely populated by representatives elected from the military.

## History

* Was originally a loose assemblage of individual nation states similar to the EU, but with a centralized military.
* This is obviously a bad idea, and two hundred years ago, a military coup during a turbulent political discussion between the member states lead to the establishment of a unifying constitution that gave the UDA superseding authority over the individual nation states.
* They have exercised this control *a lot*, and at a practical level they function in full as the main government, having established a code-of-laws that spans the gamut of the experiences of their citizens.
* Individual nation states occasionally rattle sabers about independence, but this is rare.
* The largest challenge to the authority of the UDA presently is the [[Peoples Liberation Army]], which is an armed rebellion working to take on the UDA's navy directly, but they've made very little headway.
