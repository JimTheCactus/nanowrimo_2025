This is a dropping place for all of the planning and plotting that can't, won't, or absolutely resists being usefully placed with anything else. Most early planning goes here as a result.

## Possible genres

* Suspense
* Cyberpunk
* Fantasy
* Isekai (Wait... Was my first win an isekai? I had put it as post zombie apocolypse, but it might still count in a way.)
* Mystery
* Romance / Relationship

## Interesting themes

* Complex geopolitics requiring nuanced solutions that ultimately are never complete solutions
    * As a reminder, I'm writing from an ***extremely privileged position***. I need to carefully consider my work to make sure I'm not writing things such that "someone like me" magically fixes everything or has it *the worst*. (Political scarecrow Mary Sue. XD)
* Asexuality
    * Aegosexuality?
    * Sexual self-discovery
    * What if I don't talk about it using any labels, but just demonstrate how I want things to go and offer contrast
* Sexism in practical spaces
* Anti-intellectualism and how intellectuals reinforce those ill feelings by trying to divide the world up along the same line just in reverse.

## Possible Plots

* Flanked by Love - But an office romance
    * Imagine the Flanked By Love crew, but set in a more "The Office" or "The IT Crowd" kind of setting
    * Explore the kind of relationship I think I currently want: Something where the classified ad would be:
        * Wanted: Cuddle Buddy for Tuesdays and Sundays, 8p to 11p.
        * Primary tasks would include extended makeout sessions, watching TV programs, playing video games together while in each other's laps.
        * Staying overnight (including sharing sleeping arrangements) may be possible, but is dependent on circumstances. Inquire for details.
        * No sex, but manual stimulation can be offered.
    * I think I might have to make a new set of characters to do that particular exploration. The Suki/Jim relationship looks like Steph/Kerry or Chi/Hideki (I wonder if Steph and Kerry would appreciate that I see their relationships as adjacent on the romance plane. )
    * This also breaks my entire story management system. Like I can't post this to *GitLab* XD. Gonna have to change things up.

## Notes to self
* We're going to be writing in the world of Flanked by Love.
* The novel is a sequel, but importantly, it is NOT bound by the events and exact details or characterization of that novel.
	* I wrote it in 2010. No one but me has read it since then, and I haven't really read it cover-to-cover since 2015. No one, not even myself, is in a good position to get pedantic about me mischaracterizing a character, or making a plot hole.
	* If you don't know what to do, guess about what would have happened in the last novel, but that doesn't mean you need to go back and read the whole stupid thing.
* "If you claim we're friends, but you hate my vibes, then we're not friends and you're just using me for something."
* ADHD help
	* Body Doubling
	* Monotasking
		* Set a timer, so a thing, do the thing. (Pamodora?)
		* Make a parking lot
	* Motivation bridge
		* Make Urgent
		* Make Novel
		* Make it personally interesting
	* Exercise
	* Point of Performance
		* Put stuff where you need it!
