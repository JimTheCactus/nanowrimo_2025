* Average height and normal build for a wolfen
* Currently in an on-again-off-again relationship with the cute aft engineer.
* After the [[Jacobson Scandal]], he joined the [[Hapley Military Academy]] to support Sam in her work teaching [[N-Dimensional Jump Theory]]
	* After a year with [[Professor Samantha -Sam- Collins|Sam]], Sam broke up him. Their breakup was at least somewhat amicable, and they are on not hostile terms, but they don't hang out.
* He realized that student instruction wasn't really his jam anyway and decided that it would be best taking a job with the station outside of the Academy would buy him the distance he needed.
