![[Profile Suki Saotomi.jpg|A small, subdued looking 5 foot robot girl in a maid outfit standing with very long black hair in the galley of a spaceship directing robots to fry eggs on a stove. Anime, safe for work]]
- Her main terminal's chassis is modeled after a [[human]] girl.
- Has multiple drone terminals
- Her central processing core on the station, though each terminal can be autonomous, but they're not sentient.
- VERY strong, very dense.
- Social stigma: Android
- Lives to serve, though somewhat due to programming
- Is in a long-term unrecognized partnership with [[Senior Instructor James -Jim- Garson|Jim]]
- Has daddy issues. Her “father” was a scientist who treated the budding AI core as a tool, rather than a person. Suki wanted to be loved by her father but he never reciprocated. Jim’s excitement at naming her (something her father had refused to do, always referring to her as Prototype 1.4) was part of what caused her budding love for him.
- Her AI was actually bootstrapped from her father’s daughter’s brain. He had been keeping her in stasis in the research lab. Eventually one of the researchers couldn’t take it any more and explained to Suki what happened. Suki tried to verify it herself from the lab computers. Appalled by what she found out she mounted a rescue mission with the researcher’s help to save the daughter but she was disrupted with a backdoor command from her father who then proceeded to shoot the researcher and wipe her core back to the point where his coworker intervened. (3 days)
- After the [[Jacobson Scandal]], she was transferred at the behest of [[Professor Samantha -Sam- Collins|Sam]]and [[Senior Instructor James -Jim- Garson|Jim]] to be the core AI of the newly founded [[Brenner Station]], home of the equally new [[Hapley Military Academy]]. 
* Her favorite place on the station is Maintenance tube 4Q-714J
	* It's the maintenance tube that joins Jim's class room to Jim's laboratory and is her favorite place for secret rendezvous.
