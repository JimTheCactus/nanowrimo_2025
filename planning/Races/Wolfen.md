- Muscular Wolf-Like humanoids
- Have fluffy, dog-like tails.
- Exceptional strength compared to humans
- Carnivorous. Can and will eat non-meat, but their diet is typically at least 70% meat.
- Differs from wolves in that they do not have “litters”
- Shed twice a year or so. But without planetary reference it kinda happens with its own mind.
- Like Earth dogs they can't sweat, and instead shed heat by panting, drinking, and covering themselves with water.
	- This makes them ill-suited for long duration running.
- Were originally genemodded dogs from earth. They spent several centuries in servitude before being liberated by the [[Rokk]] and given their own homeworld to develop: [[Yellowstone]].
- The Wolfen homeworld participates in the [[United Dimensions Alliance|UDA]]
- Sexually Dimorphic
	- Males:
		- Fur is more bristly. Tends to have less sheen.
		- Same dimorphic elements as Human males
		- Str: + 4
		- Height Range (2 sigma): 6’3” – 7’4”
		- Weight range (2 sigma): 300 – 450 lbs
		- Monochromatic. 
	- Females:
		- Fur is smoother, more fine. Tends to have a better sheen
		- Same dimorphic elements as human females
		- Str: + 3
		- Height range (2 sigma): 6’0” – 7’0”
		- Weight range (2 sigma): 250 – 375 lbs
		- Dichromatic. Underbelly is typically white, though some blacks turn up (recessive genetic trait with positive selecting factors for it due to black being “sexy”)
