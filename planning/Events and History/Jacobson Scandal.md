* Happened 10 years ago (everyone is 10 years older)
* Admiral Jacobson had been responsible for the [[Theran IV]] research laboratories, including the labs that [[Professor Samantha -Sam- Collins|Sam]] worked at, as well as the AI research center that birthed [[Suki Saotomi|Prototype 4]] - Suki
* The Renegade, and it's crew ([[Professor Samantha -Sam- Collins|Sam]], [[Commander Jake Simmons|Jake]], [[Lt. Laurance Hapley|Laurance]], [[Senior Instructor James -Jim- Garson|Jim]], and [[Suki Saotomi|Suki]]), along with a compliment of PLA agents ended up infiltrating the AI Research center and threatened to release the specifics of the AI and superweapons research if admiral Jacobson wasn't brought to justice.
